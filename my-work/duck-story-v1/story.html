    <h1>Ah, the nostalgia.</h1>
    <p>It is unlikely that I will ever take time to fix and complete this. This
      is a good example of why beginner projects should be simple. This project,
      unfortunately, devolved into something that became very difficult to
    maintain and scale.</p>

    <p>
      Once upon a time there was a duck.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now what was the color of tha duck again?
    </p>

    <p>
      I think it was a {DuckColor} duck.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ah, yes! That's it! It was a very normal looking {DuckColor} duck.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, where is that duck? She was just around here somewhere.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's see......
    </p>

    <p>
      ah!
    </p>
    <p>
      there she is.

      One day duck was splashing in the pond with her best friend:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Frog
      </li>
    </ul>

    </pre>

    <p>
      Ducks best friend was a [frog, dog, hog, carton of eggnog] named {friend}.
    </p>

    <p>
      I always forget what color {friend} was. Do you remember?
    </p>

    <p>
      Oh, how could I forget. {friend} was a beautiful shade of {friendColor} of course!
    </p>


    <p>
      "You sure are one goofy friend, {friend}." Duck said as they splashed together.
    </p>
    <p>
      {friend} laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Duck laughed.
    </p>

    <p>
      After a little while it started to rain.
    </p>

    <p>
      How bad was the rain storm?
    </p>

    <p>
      not too bad ------0------ Really bad
    </p>

    <p>
      "we should get out of the water during a rainstorm.", said {friend}.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Yeah. I'm getting hungry anyways. What should we eat today?"
    </p>

    <p>
      What should she eat?
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Pizza
      </li>
      <li>
        bag of pudding
      </li>
      <li>
        Grapes
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      "Let's eat {food}", said {friend}.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Pizza Story
    </h2>
    <p>
      So, duck and {friend} decided to head into town to visit a pizza shop they had seen a few times.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was called Pizza Fantastic. And it was truly the most fantastic pizza place they had ever seen.
    </p>

    <p>
      As soon as they walked in the door, a lady screamed
    </p>

    <p>
      "AAAAHHHHH OH EM GEEEE IT'S A DUCK AND A {friend}!!!!!! SHOO SHOO!!!"
    </p>

    <p>
      The owner, Mr. Fantastic, came over.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry, guys." He said. "I can only serve paying customers today."
    </p>

    <p>
      Duck and {friend} had to leave.
    </p>

    <p>
      "That wasn't very fantastic", said {friend}.
    </p>
    <p>
      Duck nodded.
    </p>

    <p>
      "But, I bet we could still get some pizza if we are sneaky."
    </p>

    <p>
      "How is that?" asked {friend}.
    </p>

    <p>
      "We'll start a band! And then when we play music people will pay us money and we can use that to get pizza!", said duck.
    </p>

    <p>
      "That sounds awesome!", said {friend}. 
    </p>

    <p>
      So, they got some music stuff together and practiced real hard.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, they felt like they were ready.
    </p>

    <p>
      They went back to Pizza Fantastic and started playing one of the songs they rehearsed outside the pizza shop.
    </p>

    <p>
      Which song should they play:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        {song1}
      </li>
      <li>
        {song2}
      </li>
      <li>
        {song3}
      </li>
    </ul>

    <b>
      *They play the song*
    </b>

    <p>
      How good was that song?
    </p>

    <p>
      real good -------0-------- Not very good
    </p>


    <p>
      That was a {rating} song! Duck and {friend} made {prorated money amount}!
    </p>
    <p>
      They still need {money left to get a pizza}.
    </p>

    <p>
      What should they play next?
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        {song1}
      </li>
      <li>
        {song2}
      </li>
      <li>
        {song3}
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      -- repeat as necessary --
    </p>


    <p>
      FINALLY!! They had enough money to buy a pizza!
    </p>

    <p>
      "Now we just have to find a way to sneak inside without getting caught by that scary screaming lady." {friend} said.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Let's go around the back.", said duck.
    </p>


    <p>
      So, they went around the back and when Mr. Fantastic came outside to take out the trash they snuck inside and grabbed a pizza and left the cash on the counter.
    </p>


    <p>
      YAYY!
    </p>

    <p>
      Duck and Frog were so happy they did a little dance in it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The end.
    </p>


    <h2>
      Grape story
    </h2>

    <p>
      "Good idea {friend}", said duck. "As a matter of fact a friend of mine said theres a guy who gives grapes to ducks (and other animals) not too far from here!"
    </p>

    <p>
      So they went to the park where they found a few food carts and snack vendors.
    </p>

    <p>
      "He's the one who runs the lemonade stand.", said duck confidently.
    </p>

    <p>
      they walk up to the lemonade stand.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Hey." says duck.
    </p>

    <p>
      "got any grapes?"
    </p>

    <p>
      The man puts down the newspaper he is reading and he looks furious.
    </p>

    <p>
      He immediately grabs a bottle of glue and starts to chase them screaming "NOT AGAIN! I WILL STOP YOU THIS TIME! LEAVE MY LEMONADE STAND ALONE!!!"
    </p>

    <p>
      Man runs at them and says "I'M GONNA GLUE YOU TO A TREE!!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      duck and {friend} get really big eyes. and {friend} says "RUN FOR IT!"
    </p>

    <p>
      [chasing game - outrun the crazy lemonade stand guy]
    </p>

    <p>
      Game ends with them either getting caught and glued to a tree (retry) or running into another stand but this ones a grape stand.
    </p>

    <p>
      And the guy gives them some grapes.
    </p>

    <p>
      the end.
    </p>


    <h2>
      bag of pudding
    </h2>

    <p>
      just then, {friend} remembered something.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Why don't we eat some of that bag of pudding we have been saving?!" said {friend} excitedly.
    </p>

    <p>
      "oh yeah that's a great idea!", said duck. I think I left it under that old bridge.
    </p>

    <b>
      under the old bridge
    </b>

    <p>
      duck lifts the bag of pudding into the air. A bird swoops down and swipes it.
    </p>

    <p>
      then flies up into a tree.
    </p>

    <p>
      "HEY!!" they both shout.
    </p>

    <p>
      "GIVE THAT BACK!!" but the bird ignores them.
    </p>

    <p>
      "I guess we have to climb that tree." says duck.
    </p>

    <p>
      [tree climbing game]
    </p>
    <b>
      ** use mouse to jump from branch to branch avoiding some of the other residents of the tree. like owls and squirrels. **
    </b>

    <p>
      Ends with them getting the bag of pudding and drinking out of it with straws.
    </p>

    <p>
      the end.
