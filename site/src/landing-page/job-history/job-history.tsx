            I came on board at Cherry Lane to build a maintainable web app that
            would allow us to sell, track, and advertise puppies. A major goal
            of this project was minimal cost. I was able to achieve this by
            using Cloudflare Pages and Workers to host the site and serverless
            functions. In the end, the only overhead cost was the domain name.

        I am a software engineer with a background in public relations and

        engine optimized content is my specialty.
      </Preamble>
      <Preamble>
        Everything I build is lean, fast, secure, and accessible. I am a firm
        believer in the idea that the internet should be for everyone.
      </Preamble>
      <Preamble>
        Good tests usher good software. I meticulously test everything I build
        and can use any testing suite.

      <Preamble>
        Typescript seems to be what I work with the most, but Python is a close
        second. My database experience ranges from SQLite to PostgreSQL to
        NoSQL.
      </Preamble>
      <Preamble>
        Recently, I have taken up creating my own SaaS built on Rust. (The code
        is not yet open but plans to be in the future.)
      </Preamble>
      <Preamble>
        Flipping between front-end and back-end development is something I am
        fairly comfortable with, although I tend to work on the front-end more.
